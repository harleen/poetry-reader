Most Dangerous

The most dangerous thing is not the looting of another's labor.
The most dangerous thing is not the beatings of the police.
The most dangerous thing is not a punch of betrayal greed.

It's bad, no doubt, to be seized while sleeping. 
It's bad, no doubt, to be enveloped in fearful silence but 
it is not the most dangerous thing.

Inside deception's commotion, 
it's bad, no doubt, for good people to stay silent.
It's bad, no doubt, to read secretly under the light of a firefly but 
it is not the most dangerous thing.

The most dangerous thing is
to be filled with deceased peace.
Smothering every heartache;
going from home to work,
from work to home.
The most dangerous thing is—
       the death of your dreams.

The most dangerous is that timepiece
that is running on your wrist
but is at standstill in your eyes.

The most dangerous eye is one
that sees everything but is frozen.
One that has forgotten how to kiss the world with love.
One that drowns in the blinding steam of materialistic things.
One that stamps on the simplicity of everyday life
but gets lost in orders like a donkey running circuits.

The most dangerous moon is one
that after any murder, any disaster
rises in empty courtyards
but does not sting like pepper in your eyes. 

The most dangerous song is one
that to reach your ears
can only mourn
at the front door of the frightened 
and cough like a villain.

The most dangerous night is one
that falls on the skies of living souls,
inside the only sound is owls, yipping jackals,
and sticks like a blackhole to closed door frames.

The most dangerous direction is one 
in which the sun of conscience sets
and a piece of that dead sunshine's skin 
lodges itself in your body's east.

The most dangerous thing is not the looting of another's labor.
The most dangerous thing is not the beatings of the police.
The most dangerous thing is not a punch of betrayal greed.
