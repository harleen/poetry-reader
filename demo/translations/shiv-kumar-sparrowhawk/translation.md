Sparrowhawk

Mother! O Mother
I made a sparrowhawk friend.
On it's head, a proud crest
and on it's feet—bells;
it followed a trail of seed to me.
Oh, sacrifice me!

One, its beauty is
sunlight blazing.
Second, it is carved from perfumes.
Third, it is the color of rose;
some beautiful mother's offspring.
Oh, sacrifice me!

It's eyes
an evening in March
and it's hair—clouds in July.
Within it's lips October's
form, ready to rise.
Oh, sacrifice me!

In it's breath
hibiscus flowers plucked from
a garden planted by the moon.
Within it's body dances spring
showered by fragrances.
Oh, sacrifice me!

In it's words
a breeze from the east.
It sings as if a cuckoo's silhouette.
Teeth white like a heron in flight
shooed from the rice fields by a clap. 
Oh, sacrifice me!

Love's
one woven bed
I laid down in moonlight.
But the body sheet turned dirty
after placing a single foot.
Oh, sacrifice me!

Now, an aching in the
hollows of my inner eyes;
within a flood of tears.
All night I spent in thoughts—
what is this torment I sowed?
Oh, sacrifice me!

Early morning
with soap I scrubbed 
and scrubbed—helped it bathe.
It's figure crackled, sparkled,
and my hand was left withered.
Oh, sacrifice me!

I made choori
but it did not eat, instead
I feed it flesh off my own heart. 
One such flight it flew—
it never came back.
Oh, sacrifice me!

Mother! O Mother
I made a sparrowhawk friend.
