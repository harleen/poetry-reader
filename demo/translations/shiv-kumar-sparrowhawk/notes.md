The repetition of “Oh, sacrifice me!” (vari jaan) throughout the poem creates a haunting sense that something consequential will happen to the speaker, who is clearly smitten from the outset (refrain recurring after nearly every stanza).

By the end of the poem, this anticipated sacrifice becomes literal: the speaker feeds the sparrowhawk pieces of their own heart (“I feed it flesh off my own heart”), completing the arc set up by the repeated refrain.

The line “But the body sheet turned dirty / after placing a single foot” introduces ambiguity around who or what is made “dirty.” This ambiguity gives the poem a philosophical dimension—perhaps suggesting that love, once consummated or embodied, loses its purity.

The direct address to the mother (“Mother! O Mother”) frames the poem and is a powerful structural choice, lending the poem a confessional tone and grounding the experience of desire in intimacy and witness.
