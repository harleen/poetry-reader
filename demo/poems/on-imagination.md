On Imagination

Thy various works, imperial queen,
We view with pleasure, and admire;
All conspire to raise thy praise.

Thy wond’rous acts in beauteous order stand,
And all attest how potent is thine hand.

From Helicon’s refulgent springs
Supremely flows the fount of fame;
Above the reach of mortal things,
Thy towering pinions court the sky.

When first thy pencil did design,
And breathed the mimick’d life divine,
When first thy pencil did design,
And breathed the mimick’d life divine,
How did those prospects give delight!

We on thy wonders gaze with joy,
Admire, applaud, and love;
And in thy bright ideas find
A kindred fire.
