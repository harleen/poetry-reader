Poems for Memorizing

It's late February, and both cottonwoods have sprouted buds. The woodpeckers who nest inside are surprisingly aggressive toward the scrub jays these days; I expect a baby in spring. 

The day after the rains is a spectacular show. The sun rose today wearing a yellow pashmina with long streaks of pale pink and baby blue. En route from preschool I noticed the waxing gibbous moon framed in borderless deep blue. I caught it on my phone hanging between two overhead electrical wires. 

This week I found a book called Poems for Memorizing: Grade One to Nine. Inside the cover a handwritten date, from which I inferred it was printed before 1921. In 2025, my daughter does not have to memorize anything at school except for skip-counting songs. She is, like me, bad at spelling, so I help her put together words and memorize those that do not match their sound.
