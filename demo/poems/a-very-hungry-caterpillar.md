A Very Hungry Caterpillar

I am pouring myself in.

Yesterday, it came with nature.

Later, it was a force of nurture.

Now I can only remember—bits of the beforetime.

I am empty and full.

In my own time machine.

Was I a butterfly? Or becoming one?

Peel my layers one at a time.

Let me metamorphose in front of your eyes. 

Behold. 

I am a dream of a beast, carried inside the wind, made from the flight of birds, powered by the seas.
